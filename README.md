# Academic Website

The project is aimed at developing a Academic website for a college.
The Academic Information Management is a web based application.
Student can visit the website to know about their marks and courses
using their credentials and they can also change their login password.
This system can be used as an application for the Academic
Information Database to manage the studentâ€™s information. Admins
will be able to add new courses, register new admins,update scores in
existing courses,add new students,update score of student. The changes
will be stored in database.
